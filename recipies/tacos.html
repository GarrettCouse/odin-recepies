        <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p>This recipe is one of our favorite Mexican ground beef recipes. Ground beef is such a versatile meat and we love making real Mexican tacos with it.
            </p>
        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Ground beef (or other meat, see below)</li>
              <li>Canola oil or olive oil</li>
              <li>Tomato paste (or tomato sauce)</li>
              <li>Beef broth or water (you can also use chicken broth in a pinch)</li>
              <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
              <li>Fresh cilantro</li>
             <li>Cheese: You can use a Mexican blend shredded cheese, or you can use any type of cheese that melts well. Consider Mozzarella cheese, cheddar cheese, or Monterey Jack cheese.</li>
              <li>Taco seasoning: chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, dried oregano, garlic powder, sea salt, black pepper</li>
             <li>Tortillas (corn tortilla or flour tortilla in taco size)</li>
             <li>Chopped avocado or guacamole</li>
             <li>Lime wedges (for squeezing on the tacos)</li>
             <li>Sour cream (optional)</li>
             <li>Chopped onions: red onion or white onion (or onion powder)</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in your skillet for two minutes over medium-high heat. You will add your meat once the oil is hot enough to sizzle.
                Add the ground beef to the skillet and stir as the meat cooks evenly and begins to brown. This process will take between 6-8 minutes. While the meat is browning, use a wooden spoon or potato masher to break the ground beef up into smaller pieces.</li>
             <li>Once the meat is browned, add the beef broth, tomato paste, cumin, chili powder, oregano, garlic powder, sea salt, and black pepper to the skillet with the meat.
                Reduce the heat to medium and allow the meat mixture to simmer for about 3-5 minutes until the sauce becomes thick. Stir occasionally. When the sauce is thick, turn off the heat and set the skillet aside.</li>
             <li>To heat your tortillas, put the tortillas one at a time into a hot ungreased skillet or cast-iron comal (the round Mexican flat skillet) for 30 seconds on each side.
                In a pinch, you can also heat your tortillas in the microwave. Another way to heat up your tortillas is to heat them directly on a gas burner for just a few seconds, allowing the edges to become slightly charred</li>   
            <li>For each tortilla, add about 2-3 tablespoons of your taco meat mixture. Top the ground beef mixture with onion, cheese, cilantro, and tomato.
                Add whatever other garnishes you want to your tacos, including sour cream, pico de gallo, or guacamole. Squeeze the lime wedges over your tortillas.</li>
