        <h1>Description:</h1>
        <p>
            Flan is one of the easiest and most delicious Spanish desserts. Homemade flan is well worth making, I hope you’ll try it!</p>
        <h1>Ingredients:</h1>
            <ul>
            <li>Eggs: Use room temperature eggs for this flan. This recipe calls for four large eggs, but you can experiement using a mix of eggs and egg yolks if you want a denser flan. For every full egg you omit, substitute two yolks.</li>
                <li>Milk: Use whole milk here! You can also substitute part heavy cream if you’d like.</li>
                <li>Vanilla: I use top quality pure vanilla extract but you could also use vanilla bean paste. Both are delicious.</li>
                <li>Vanilla Substitutes: If you’d prefer a vanilla-free flan for some reason, a tablespoon of citrus zest is the perfect substitution.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Instructions:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by making the caramel. Put the sugar into a saucepan and heat over medium-low, stirring frequently, until it turns into a golden brown syrup. In the meantime, place your ramekins on a baking tray and surround them with hot water (bain-marie).</li>
            <li>Pour the caramel into the ramekins. Then make the custard. Start by cracking the eggs into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and beat until creamy.</li>
            <li>Add the milk and vanilla and beat until well combined. Then pour into the ramekins.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and put in the oven. Bake for about 40 minutes (until just set — the size of your mold will affect the time). Then remove them from the water and let them come to room temperature. Finally, put them in the fridge overnight (or for at least 6 hours).</li>
            <li>Finally, it’s time to eat your flan! Remove the foil and run a butter knife around the edge of the mold. Flip carefully onto a serving plate and enjoy!</li>
